They begin their hunt at night.
These salamanders have an exceptionally slow metabolism.
Living up to 80 years they grow into giants.
The fish they hunt are scarce and salamanders have poor eyesight.
But sensory nodes on their head and body detect the slightest changes in water pressure.

Free from competition,
these giants can dine alone.
Pickings are usually thin for the salamanders,
but every year some of the world's high rivers are crowded by millions of visitors.

The salmon have arrived.
This is the world's largest fresh water fish migration.
Across the northern hemisphere,
salmon,
returning from the ocean to their spawning grounds,
battle their way for hundreds of miles upstream.

Up here,
there are fewer predators to eat their eggs and fry.
A grizzly bear.
From famine to feast -
he's spoilt for choice.
This Canadian bear is very special -
he's learnt to dive for his dinner.
But catching salmon in deep water is not that easy and the cubs have lots to learn.

The annual arrival of spawning salmon
brings huge quantities of food into these high rivers
that normally struggle to support much life.

Although relatively lifeless,
the power of the upland rivers to shape the landscape
is greater than any other stage in a river's life.

Driven by gravity,
they're the most erosive forces on the planet.

For the past 5 million years,
Arizona's Colorado river has eaten away at the desert's sandstone to create a gigantic canyon.

It's over a mile deep,
and at its widest,
it's 17 miles across.
The Grand Canyon.
This river has cut the world's longest canyon system -
a 1,000 mile scar clearly visible from space.

As rivers leave the mountains behind,
they gradually warm and begin to support more life.
Indian rivers are home to the world's most social otter -
smooth-coated otters form family groups up to 17 strong.

Group rubbing not only refreshes their coats,
but strengthens social bonds.
When it comes to fishing,
there is real strength in numbers.
Fishing practice begins when the cubs are four months old.

Only the adults have the speed and agility needed to make a catch.
Adults share their catches with their squabbling cubs.

Most otters are solitary,
but these rich warm waters can support large family groups,
and even bigger predators.

Mugger crocodiles,
eight feet long,
could easily take a single otter.
But,
confident in their gangs,
the otters will actively harass these great reptiles.
Team play wins the day.

The Mara river,
snaking across the plains of East Africa.
As the land flattens out,
rivers slow down and lose their destructive power.
Now they are carrying heavy loads of sediment that stains their waters brown.
Lines of antelope are on their march.
Each year nearly two million animals migrate across the plains,
in search of fresh green pastures.

For these thirsty herds
the rivers are not only a vital source of drinking water,
but also dangerous obstacles.

This is one of the largest concentrations of Nile crocodiles in Africa,
giants that grow over five metres long.
From memory,
the antelope are coming
and gather in anticipation.
The crocodile's jaws snap tight like a steel trap -
once they have a hold,
they never let go.

It took over an hour to drown this full-grown bull.
To surprise their prey,
crocodiles must strike with lightning speed.
Here,
only the narrowest line separates life from death.

Most rivers drain into the sea,
but some end their journey in vast lakes.
Worldwide lakes hold twenty times more fresh water than all the rivers.
The East African Rift Valley holds three of the world's largest.

The first,
smallest of the three,
is still bigger than Wales.
Its tropical waters teem
with more fish species
than any other lake.

There are 850 different of one species alone,
all of which evolved from just one single ancestor,
isolated here thousands of years ago.
These six foot wide craters are fish-made.

Carefully maintained by the males,
these bowls are courtship arenas.
These fish are caring parents.
Brooding young in the mouth is a very effective way of protecting them.

This lake can be a dangerous place.
After dark,
predatory dolphin fish emerge from their daytime lairs among the rocks.
Like packs of sharks,
they're on the prowl for sleeping fish.

In the darkness these electric fish hunt
by detecting distortions in the electric field they create around their bodies.
Any fish that trenches out will be snapped up.
The floor drops almost a mile into an abyss.

Here,
in this dead zone,
the larvae of lake fly midges
hide out away from predators.
In the rainy season,
they balloon up to the surface
and undergo a magical transformation.

At dawn the first adult midges
start to break out.
Soon,
millions upon millions of newly hatched lake flies are taking to the wing.

Early explorers told tales of lakes that smoked, as if on fire.

But these spiraling columns hundreds of feet high are mating flies.

Once the flies have mated,
they will all drop to the water surface,
release their eggs and die.

This may look like an inland sea,
but it's dwarfed by the world's largest lake in Eastern Siberia.

400 miles long and over a mile deep,
This lake contains one fifth of all the fresh water
found in our planet's lakes and rivers.

For five months of the year it's sealed by an ice sheet over three feet thick.
This is the oldest lake in the world and,
despite the harsh conditions,
life flourishes here in isolation.

80 percent of its species are found nowhere else on Earth,
including the world's only fresh water seal.

With this seal,
and its marine-like forests of sponges
This seems more like
an ocean than a lake.

There are shrimp-like creatures -
as large as mice.
They are the key scavengers in this lake.
