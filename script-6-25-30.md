The struggles to survive on these remote lands reflect
the challenges faced by all life on Earth.

This tiny island,
home to the pygmy three-teed sloth.

This is a male,
and life here suits him well.
Mangroves provide all the leaves he can eat and there are no predators to worry him.

Island life may seem idyllic,
but it comes at a price.
There are only a few hundred pygmy sloths in existence,
and he needs a mate.

That's an enticing call...
...from a female somewhere out there.
And this,
for a sloth,
is a quick reaction.

The problem is there's deep water between them.
So what should any red-blooded sloth do?
Swim, of course.

Could this be her?
He does his best to put on a turn of speed.

But she's not the one.
She already has a baby and she won't mate again
until it leaves her in about six months' time.
Even life on a paradise island can have its limitations.
But at least she can't be far away.

The world's entire population of pygmy sloths is isolated on a speck of land no bigger than New York's Central Park.
The size of an island has a huge influence on the fate of those cast away there.

This island in Indonesia.
Home to dragons.
Ten feet long and massive,
these are the largest living lizards on the planet.

It's unusual to find large predators on islands.
Yet,
for four million years,
the Komodo dragon has dominated here.

It might seem there wouldn't be enough food to support such giants
on this relatively small island,
but reptiles,
being cold-blooded,
need only about a tenth of the food a mammal would.
A single meal will last a dragon a month.

They're so successful,
that their only serious competition comes from others of their own kind,
and there are some 2,000 of them here.

This giant, however,
isn't looking for food.
He's looking for a mate.
Female dragons come into season only once a year.

She is receptive.
So far, so good.
But he strayed into someone else's patch.
Another huge male thinks he is the king here.

Space being limited on islands,
dragon territories overlap,
and that creates continual conflict.

In dragon society,
size is everything.
But if rivals are closely matched,
the outcome can be uncertain.

Muscular tails strike with the power of sledgehammers.
And their serrated teeth
are as sharp as steak knives.

Each tries to topple his opponent.
Defeated.
Only the most powerful dragons win the right to mate.

The limited food and space on the small islands can often lead to intense competition.
But some islands are immense.
More like miniature continents.
And these provide opportunities for life to experiment and evolve.

This is one of the biggest islands and also one of the oldest,
having split away from Africa over 120 million years ago.
With time and isolation,
its animals have adapted to take advantage of every available niche.

The island now has thousands of different species,
most found nowhere else on Earth.

These are not monkeys, but lemurs.
From a single ancestor,
about a hundred,
different types have evolved.

The largest lemur seldom comes down from the branches.

The much smaller ring-tails wander in troops across the forest floor searching for fruit.
And tiny bamboo lemurs eat nothing except bamboo.

With few competitors,
lemurs have been free to roam
every environment on the island,
even the most extreme.

This baby lemur has a hard life ahead of it.
He's been born in the most arid and hostile corner of this vast landscape.

If he is to survive here,
he has much to learn.

The spiny forest is like a desert.
It rarely rains, so water and food is very hard to find.
Moving from tree to tree is a perilous business.
Here,
nearly all the plants are covered with ferocious spines.

His mother searches the treetops for the youngest leaves.
They provide the only food and water to sustain the family.

At three months old,
the youngster is starting to explore.

All too soon, he will have to fend for himself up here.

But it's altogether easier to stay on Mother's back.

If he can master the strange ways of this forest,
he will have a little corner to himself.

Island life encourages animals to do things differently,
and on some islands, that is essential.

There are islands still forming today built by volcanoes.
Some erupt explosively,
others pour out rivers of molten rock,
lava.

In the last 50 years,
ten new volcanic islands have been formed.

Newly created and often remote,
they're hard to reach.

Even those that do,
find these are tough places to survive.

This island in the Pacific Ocean is still
young and still volcanically active,
it's a desolate place.

The surrounding sea, however,
is particularly rich with life,
and the frontier between these two very different worlds
is the home of one of the strangest reptiles,
sea-going iguanas.

They are vegetarians,
but since there's little food for them on the land,
marine iguanas graze on the sea floor.

A big male like this one can dive to ninety feet and hold his breath for half an hour.

There are more than 7,000 individuals on this island alone.
And by bringing nutrients from the sea to the land,
the iguanas help other animals to survive here,
too.

Crabs feed on dead skin on the iguanas' back and,
in turn,
provide a welcome service.

Smaller lizards prey on the flies that pester the colony.
But not all the relationships on this island are so harmonious.

Marine iguanas lay their eggs in sand.
In June, when the hatchlings emerge,
they're vulnerable.

They must join the adults at the edge of the sea.
But the journey will be a dangerous one.

Racer snakes.
The snakes missed their chance.
But more babies are hatching.
And now the snakes are on the alert.

This is the best feeding opportunity they will get all year.

On flat ground a baby iguana can outrun a racer snake.
But others are waiting in ambush.
