This leopard -
the rarest cat in the world.
Here,
in the forests of eastern Russia
the winter makes hunting very difficult.

Prey animals are scarce,
and there's no concealing vegetation.
The cub is a year old and still dependent on its mother.

Deer are frequent casualties of the harsh winter,
and these leopards are not above scavenging from a corpse.
African leopards could never survive here,
but the Russian cats have thick fur to shield them from the cold.
There are only forty of these leopards left in the wild,
and that number is falling.

Like so many creatures,
the cats have been pushed to the very edge of extinction by hunting,
and by the destruction of their habitat.

This leopard symbolizes the fragility of our natural heritage.
The future of an entire species hangs on survival of a tiny number of mothers like this one.

All animals, rare or common,
ultimately depend for their energy on the sun.

In Japan the arrival of the cherry blossom announces the beginning of spring.

The sun's energy brings color to the landscape.
The earth,
as it makes its annual journey around the sun,
spins on a tilted axis.

And it's this tilt that creates the seasons.
The advance of the seasons brings constant change.
As the sun's influence diminishes in the north,
so the forests of America begin to shut down
losing their leaves in preparation for the dark cold months ahead.

One season hands over to another.
Some organisms thrive on decay,
but most must make special preparations for winter and a life with little sun.

Whole populations of animals are now forced to travel great distances
in pursuit of food and warmth.

300,000 teal birds gather to escape from the Siberian winter by migrating south to Korea -
the world's entire population in a single flock.
But there are parts of the world that have no seasons.
In the tropics the sun's rays strike the earth head on
and their strength is more or less constant all year round.

That is why the jungle grows so vigorously,
and supports so much life.
This forest covers only 3 percent of the planet's surface,
but it contains more than 50 percent of all its plants and animals.

The canopy is particularly rich.
There are monkeys, birds
and millions of species of insects,
exactly how many we have no idea.

The character of the forest changes as we descend,
becoming ever darker and damper,
favoring different kinds of animals and plants.
Less than 2 percent of the sunlight reaches the floor,
but even here there is extraordinary variety.

In the great island of New Guinea,
there are 42 different species of birds of paradise,
each more bizarre than the last.

This forest is so rich that nourishing food can be gathered very quickly.
That leaves the male six-plumed bird of paradise with time to concentrate on other matters,
like tidying up his display area.

Everything must be spick and span.
All is ready.
Very impressive,
but no one is watching.
The superb bird of paradise calls to attract a female.
And he has more luck.

But what does he have to do to really impress her?
She retires to consider her verdict.
It's hard not to feel deflated,
when even your best isn't good enough.

The sun influences life in the oceans just as it does on land.
Its richest parts are those where waves and currents bring fertilizing nutrients
to surface waters that are bathed in sunlight.
The seas off the Cape in South Africa have this magic recipe,
and they are hugely productive.

Summer is the time of plenty and it's now that the seals start to breed.

The strike of a great white shark lasts a mere second.
Slowing it down forty times reveals the technique and immense strength
of this massive predator.
If surprise fails,
there will be a chase.
The shark is faster on a straight course,
but it can't turn as sharply as the seal,
its agility versus power.

Once the seals have finished breeding,
the giant sharks will move on.
It's now becoming clear that great whites migrate thousands of miles across the oceans
to harvest seasonal abundances in different seas.

The sun,
beating down on tropical waters,
powers the weather systems of the globe.
Moisture evaporates from the warming ocean,
and rises to create great storms.

The winds generated out at sea sweep inland across the continents.
As they travel across the desert,
they create the biggest of all sand storms,
blowing sand halfway round the world to fertilize the Amazon jungle.

Winds blowing across the Indian Ocean collect moisture
and sweep northwards towards the Himalayas.
As the air rises,
so it cools.
The water it carries condenses into clouds
and then falls as the life-giving rains of the monsoon.

So air currents powered by the sun carry wet air to the middle of continents.
Without water there can be no life,
but its distribution over the land is far from even.

Deserts cover one third of the land's surface,
and they're growing bigger every year.
This is a desert in Southern Africa.
It's the dry season,
and thousands of elephants have started to travel in desperate search for water.

All across Southern Africa animals are journeying for the same reason.
Buffalo join the great trek.
Nowhere else on Earth are so many animals on the move with the same urgent purpose.

They're all heading for swamps,
a vast inland delta.

At the moment it is dry,
but water is coming.
The travelers are hampered by dangerous dust storms.
Females and calves can easily get separated from the main herd.
For this pair sanctuary lies in the patch of woodland a few miles ahead.

They can't rest until they reach it.
The main has already got there safely.
Finally,
the stragglers emerge from the dust.
The exhausted calf is still blinded by sand.
