The water here is just too cold for the bacteria that normally decompose the dead.

Most rivers do not end in lakes
but continue their journey to the sea.
The planet's indisputable super-river is the Amazon.

It carries as much water as the next top-ten biggest rivers combined.

Rising in the mountains,
its main trunk flows eastwards across Brazil.
On its way the system drains a third of South America.
Eventually,
over 4,000 miles from its source,
it empties into the Atlantic Ocean.

The Amazon transports a billion tons of sediment a year,
clearly visible at the mixing of the waters where one massive tributary,
flows into the main river.

Its waters are wonderfully rich.
To date over 3,000 species of their fish have been described -
more than in the whole of the Atlantic Ocean.

The Amazon is so large and rich in fish
that it can support fresh water dolphins.

These dolphins are huge -
more than six feet long.

In these murky waters they rely on sonar to navigate and hunt.
They work together to drive fish into the shallows.

These dolphins are highly social,
and in the breeding season,
there is stiff competition for mates.

The males hold court in a unique way.

They pick up rocks in their jaws,
and flaunt them to their attending females.

Maybe each male is trying to show how strong he is,
and that he therefore is the best father a female could have for her young.

Successful displays lead to mating.
Even for giant rivers like the Amazon
the journey to the sea is not always smooth or uninterrupted.

The border of Brazil and Argentina is home to one of the widest waterfalls
in the world -
one and a half miles across.

In flood 30 million liters of water spill over every second.

All the world's great broad waterfalls
are only found in the lower courses of their rivers.

In their final stages,
rivers broaden and flow wearily across their flat flood plains.

Each wet season here,
in Brazil,
this river overflows its banks
and floods an area the size of England.

This is the world's largest wetland.

In these slow-flowing waters,
aquatic plants flourish,
like the Victoria giant water lily with leaves eight feet across.

These underwater forests are nursery grounds for fish.
Over 300 species breed here,
including fish
and other predators.

Ripening fig trees overhanging the water's edge
provide welcome food for hungry fish.

The commotion attracts the river tiger.
They patrol,
looking for a chance to strike.
And waiting in the wings,
ready to pick off any injured fish,
are the piranhas.

The feeding frenzy quickly develops.
Piranha can strip a fish to the bone in minutes.

Great numbers of fish sustain vast flocks of water birds.
The rose-eared spoonbill is just one of the 650 bird species found in the wetlands.

They nest alongside wood stocks in colonies thousands strong.
Reptiles linger below,
waiting for a meal to fall out of the sky.

When rivers finally reach the sea,
they slow down,
release their sediment and build deltas.

In Bangladesh two rivers join to form the world's biggest.
Every year almost 2 thousand million tons of sediment,
eroded from the Himalayas,
is delivered to the ocean.

At the delta's mouth -
the largest mangrove forest in the world.

These extraordinary forests spring up throughout the tropics
in these tidal zones where rivers meet the sea.

Crab-eating monkeys are mangrove specials.
In Indonesia these monkeys have adopted a unique lifestyle -
they fish out fallen food.
The troop also uses the waters to cool off during the heat of the day.
But the channels are also the playground
for restless young monkeys.

Some of the young have even taken to underwater swimming.
They can stay down for more than 30 seconds,
and appear to do this just for fun.
Yet these swimming skills acquired during play
will certainly be useful later in life in these flooded mangrove forests.

In cooler climates,
mud is colonized by salt marsh grasses
and form one of the most productive habitats on the planet.

Greater snow geese flock to the grasses along the Atlantic coast of the United States
to rest and refuel on their long migratory journeys.

This is the end of the river's journey.
Collectively they've worn down mountains
and carried them to the sea.

And all along the way,
their fresh water has brought life and abundance to planet Earth.

When you look down on the Earth's surface,
it's impossible not to be impressed by the sheer grandeur,
splendor and power of the natural world.

It's been ten years since we explored these wonders since the first series of Planet Earth.
And since then,
much has changed.

We can now show life on our planet in entirely new ways,
bring you closer to animals than ever before,
and reveal new wildlife dramas for the very first time.

But that is not all.
The planet has changed, too.
Never have our wildernesses been as fragile and as precious as they are today.

At this crucial time for the natural world,
we will journey to every corner of the globe
to explore the greatest treasures of our living planet,
and reveal the extreme lengths animals go to survive.

Finally,
we will explore our cities to see how life is adapting to the newest habitat on Earth.
This is Planet Earth II.

There are hundreds of thousands of islands,
each one a world in miniature.
